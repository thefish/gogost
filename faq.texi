@set ItIsGOSTBaby It is GOST: do you expect serialization unification?

@table @asis

@item My signature is not validated by other implementations. What is wrong?

Try to reverse it (like @code{sign[::-1]} in Python).
Try to swap its halves (@code{sign[len(sign)/2:] + sign[:len(sign)/2]}).
Try to reverse its swapped halves too.

@value{ItIsGOSTBaby}!

@item My signature is @strong{still} not validated by other implementations!

Try to reverse digest you are signing/verifying (like @code{dgst[::-1]} in Python).

@value{ItIsGOSTBaby}!

@item Everything above did not help me. Does GoGOST sucks?

No way! You still have not tried to reverse your binary private key,
public key and swap its halves.
